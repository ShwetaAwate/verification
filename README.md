# Mahadbt Form Section - Caste Details

## Description

This project contains the HTML structure and CSS styling for a web page section featuring a form designed to collect Caste Details. It appears to be a component mimicking parts of a larger web portal, likely related to the Maharashtra Direct Benefit Transfer (Mahadbt) system, based on the included logos, navigation elements, and scheme types.

The page layout includes:
* A header with navigation links and user information.
* Logos associated with Mahadbt and the Government of Maharashtra.
* A navigation bar showcasing different benefit scheme types (e.g., Post Matric Scholarship, Farmer Schemes).
* A sidebar with links like 'Profile', 'All Schemes', and 'Grievance/Suggestion'.
* The main content area displaying the "Caste Details" form.

The form itself collects information such as:
* Caste Category
* Caste
* Whether the user possesses a Caste Certificate
* Details about the Caste Certificate (Number, Issuing District, Applicant Name, Issuing Authority)
* An option to upload the Caste Certificate file

## Files Included

* `form.html`: Defines the structure and content of the web page section using HTML.
* `form.css`: Provides the styling (layout, colors, fonts, etc.) for the elements in `form.html` using CSS.

## How to Use/View

1.  Ensure both `form.html` and `form.css` are in the same directory.
2.  Open the `form.html` file using any modern web browser.

The browser will render the page, applying the styles defined in `form.css` to the structure defined in `form.html`.
